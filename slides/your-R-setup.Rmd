## Updating R
<small>*(please don't do this in the middle of the workshop)*</small>

**Windows**
```
library(installr); updateR() # follow prompts
```

**Mac**  Visit the [website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/), download and install. 

**Linux**   Run in terminal: 
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

---
## Updating packages

* Command line - single package:  
```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::update.packages("RColorBrewer") 
```

* Command line - all packages:  

<small>*(don't run this unless you have the time to wait)*</small>
```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::update_packages(TRUE)
```

* point-and-click using RStudio's "Packages" Pane   

---
## Downgrade a package

Easiest way (if you know the version): 
```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_version("RColorBrewer", "1.0.5")
```

Downgrade to a specific point in time:   
*(note that going this far back in time usually causes problems)*
```{r eval=FALSE}
groundhog::groundhog.library("RColorBrewer", 
                             "2010-01-01")
```
How to find the version information? Visit the [package site](http://localhost:4321/2022-03-01-WhatTheyForgot) on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html).

## Installing packages when you update R

* If doing a minor update of R (e.g. 4.0.1 to 4.0.3), do nothing (packages will remain compatible)
* If doing a major R update (4.0 to 4.1), re-install packages. *Don't copy over packages directly because things may break without telling you.*

One possible [solution](https://rstats.wtf/maintaining-r.html): 
```{r eval=FALSE}
# Install new version of R (4.1 in this example)
# Create a new directory for the version of R
fs::dir_create("~/Library/R/4.1/library")
# Re-start R so the .libPaths are updated
# OR find where your R library exists already with .libPaths()
# Look up what packages were in your old package library
pkgs <- fs::path_file(fs::dir_ls("~/Library/R/3.6/library"))
# Filter these packages as needed
# Install the packages in the new version
install.packages(pkgs)
```

---
## Where does R live?

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/where_is_waldo.jpeg")
```

---
## Where the R executable(s) live(s)

This tell us the path to R that RStudio is using: 
```{r}
R.home()  
```

It can sometimes be more [complicated](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486138-Changing-R-versions-for-the-RStudio-Desktop-IDE) than that depending on the system.


---
## Where your package libraries live

```{r}
.libPaths()
```
1. main library
1. empty
1. added via the command line and updates with `sudo apt-get update`
1. "base R packages" (what is shipped with R)

R is using all of these, in order. 

---
## Check your default library

(by installing a package)

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("RColorBrewer") 
```
```
Installing package into 
‘/home/jpiaskowski/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.1’
(as ‘lib’ is unspecified)
```

#  .Renviron 

* Sets global variables: API and authentication keys
* There is often only one of these per R system, located in the home directory, but there can one per project
* DO NOT add this to a git repository or make sure it ends up in  *.gitignore* 

--
Example:

```{r eval=FALSE}
if(!file.exists(".Renviron")) file.create(".Renviron")
```

Open file and manually add: 
```{r eval=FALSE}
NOAA_KEY = 'my-secret-key'
```


Some helper functions from **usethis**: 
```{r eval=FALSE}
usethis::edit_r_environ("user") # system-wide
usethis::edit_r_environ("project") # for the current project you are in
```

---
#  .Rprofile

 
* An <mark>R script</mark> that runs every time R is opened or restarted
* there is (often) one created automatically when R is installed at the home directory
* There may be one in each **.Rproj**, this takes precedence over others
* This often goes in the git repo

---
## A possible .Rprofile

```
options(scipen=999) # force R to not use scientific notation

.First <- function() {
  cat("Welcome, High Priestess of R. 
  You are a true hero and your legend will never die.")
}

library(tidyverse) # probably not a good idea 
source("scripts/file_import.R")

.Last <- function() {
  cat('Praised be,  my R programmer.')
}
```

# Namespace conflicts

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

Only one function name can be loaded into an R session. Identical function names for packages loaded earlier must be referenced like thus: `base::filter()`. 

---
# Find conflicts: 

```{r}
getAnywhere("filter")
```


---
## Namespace solutions

* Use `::`
```{r eval=FALSE}
dplyr::filter(...)
```

* Remove conflicting packages:
```{r eval=FALSE}
unloadNamespace("offending_package")
```

* Only require packages you will use (reconsider `library(tidyverse)`)
* Load the packages with whose functions you do not want masked last
* Use the package **conflicted**

---
## A namespace solution under development:

```{r}
# devtools::install_github("r-lib/conflicted")
library(conflicted); library(dplyr)
conflict_scout()
conflict_prefer("filter", "dplyr")
```

---
# Find all the loaded namespaces:

```{r}
sort(loadedNamespaces())
```
